# Pizza-Sales-Report
I analyzed the Pizza_Sales data by using MySql_Server querry to gain insights into our business performance, 
for this i have calculated following metrics :-
1) Total Revenue

   SELECT.SUM(total_price) AS Total Revenue
       FROM pizza_sales;
2) Average Order Value

   SELECT SUM(total_price)/COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS Avg order value
       FROM pizza_sales;
3) Total Pizza Sales

   SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total Pizza Sold FROM pizza_sales;
4) Total orders

   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS Total Orders
       FROM pizza_sales;
5) Average Pizzas per order

     SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS Avg order value
         FROM pizza_sales;
6) Daily Trend for total order

    SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_id) AS order_day COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS total_orders
        FROM pizza_sales
         GROUP BY DATENAME(DW,order_id);
7) Monthly Trend for Orders

    SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, order_date) AS Month_Name COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS total_orders
       FROM pizza_sales
        GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH,order_id);;
8) % of sales by Pizza Category

SELECT pizza_category, SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue,
   SUM(total_price)*100/(SELECT.SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales)
    FROM pizza_sales
    GROUP BY pizza_category;
9) % of sales by Pizza Size
    
   SELECT pizza_size, SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue,
    SUM(total_price)*100/(SELECT.SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales)
     FROM pizza_sales
     GROUP BY pizza_size ;
10) Total pizzas sold by Category
    
   SELECT pizza_category, SUM(quantity) AS Total Quantity Sold
    FROM pizza_sales
    GROUP BY pizza_category;
11) TOP 5 Pizzas by Revenue
